option and the check button gets enabled.

When user press the submit button then -
-If user’s choice is correct then highlight in green with tick that you
made correct choice
-If user’s choice is incorrect then highlight in red with cross that you
made incorrect choice and also highlight the correct choice in green
Replace the button with “Next” to move on to the next question.
